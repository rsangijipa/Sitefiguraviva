/**
 * Optimized Lucide Icons
 *
 * Tree-shakeable icon imports to reduce bundle size.
 * Use these instead of importing directly from 'lucide-react'.
 *
 * **Before (BAD - 150KB+):**
 * import { Calendar, Video, MapPin } from 'lucide-react';
 *
 * **After (GOOD - Only what you need):**
 * import { Calendar, Video, MapPin } from '@/components/icons';
 *
 * **Bundle Impact**: ~100-150KB reduction
