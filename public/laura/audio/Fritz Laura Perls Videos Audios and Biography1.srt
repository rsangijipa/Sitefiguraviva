00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,440
Speaker1:

I distinguish two types of work.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:15,280
One is the weekend seminar, 
which is a kind of sampling where you get

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,160
acquainted with our approach and those of you 
who want to work are welcome,

4
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:30,040
and you see that you will learn a lot by 
participating.

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,440
You're also free to interrupt and make 
comments.

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:44,720
Usually I do not answer questions because I 
don't believe there are answers.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:51,440
I believe we are always looking for the right 
question to the answer,

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,920
which is already given beforehand.

9
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:04,440
Which immediately leads us to what I believe 
are the two key words in Gestalt therapy.

10
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,160
These two key words, if you understand them.

11
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,600
I believe you have the whole story.

12
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:23,200
The two key words are now and how.

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:37,480
2 or 3 letter words. This sounds very

14
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:41,800
simple. At the same time.

15
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:53,160
I have to warn you, because to get to that 
spontaneity and authenticity which we in our

16
00:01:53,800 --> 00:02:00,000
endeavor of bringing about possibly a 
humanistic revolution.

17
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,760
You already have a certain amount of 
humanistic rebellion,

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,560
but not yet a revolution.

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,520
But to bring about that state.

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,200
To save the genuineness of the human being.

21
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:22,440
Or let me talk and try religious terms to 
regain our soul,

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:30,320
or to talk in American terms, 
to revive the American corpse and make him

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
bring him back to life.

24
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:39,480
Now, the paradox is to get this spontaneity 
we need,

25
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,320
just like in Zen, an utmost discipline.

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,800
And the discipline is simply to understand, 
to break it off.

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,880
Anything that is not contained in the words 
now and how.

28
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,880
I know you used to ask why?

29
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,600
Like every child, like every immature person.

30
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:14,720
Ask why? To get rationalizations or 
explanations.

31
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:21,080
But the why at best leads to a clever, 
clever explanation,

32
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:23,920
but not never to an understanding.

33
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:32,720
So let me say a few words more about the two 
words now and how.

34
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,360
The dogma is nothing exists except the now.

35
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:51,600
And now is the present, 
is the phenomenon is what you are aware of.

36
00:03:54,440 --> 00:04:01,760
It is that moment. In which you carry your 
so-called memories.

37
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,240
And your so-called anticipations with you.

38
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,200
The past is not more. The past is past.

39
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,840
And the past. What happened in the past is 
either assimilated.

40
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,760
And has become a part of us.

41
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,200
Or we carry around an unfinished situation.

42
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,480
An incomplete gestalt.

43
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,400
Let me give you an example.

44
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:50,840
The most famous of the unfinished situations 
is the fact that we have not forgiven our

45
00:04:50,840 --> 00:05:00,790
parents. Especially if we are beset with the 
curse

46
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:06,230
of perfectionism. Or idealism.

47
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:10,590
Then we discover our parents are never right.

48
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:17,230
Or marriages. The husband or the wife is 
never right because they don't measure up to

49
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,030
this impossible yardstick of the ideal.

50
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:29,750
The perfectionist in marriage, 
for instance,

51
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:36,670
is not in love with his wife, 
his love with his ideal.

52
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,910
And he demands from his wife that she should 
fit into this Procrustes bed of this ideal,

53
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,310
and she blames her if she does not fit.

54
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:52,350
What this ideal exactly is, 
he would not reveal.

55
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,390
Now and then there might be some 
characteristics,

56
00:05:56,390 --> 00:06:01,190
but the essence of the ideal is that it is 
impossible.

57
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:11,110
Unobtainable. Just a good opportunity to 
swing the whip.

58
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,590
If you carry this ideal, 
this perfectionistic ideal around with

59
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:27,510
yourself, you have a wonderful tool to play 
the beloved game of the neurotic,

60
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:29,030
the self-torture game.

61
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:37,990
There is no end to the self-torture and to 
the self nagging self castigating.

62
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:45,430
It hides under the mask of self improvement.

63
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:55,190
It never works. It will come across all the 
constellation,

64
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,670
the how it can not work.

65
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:05,350
Now switching back to the now.

66
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:16,030
Now I am pulling out of my drawer the 
memories.

67
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:23,030
And possibly believe that these memories are 
identical with my history.

68
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:34,870
It's never true. We abstract certain 
experiences

69
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,910
from the world and then file it away as 
memory.

70
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:41,950
And if the memory, then.

71
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:51,190
Is unpleasant. Especially if it's unpleasant 
to our self-esteem,

72
00:07:52,110 --> 00:08:01,710
we change it. None of the so-called Freudian 
traumata has ever been proved

73
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:10,310
to exist. These traumata are always 
falsification,

74
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:12,190
or in most cases, inventions.

75
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:21,910
I suggest that you read a beautiful little 
pocket book called I Never Promised You a

76
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:29,030
Rose garden. We've got such an instance about 
this invented memory.

77
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:36,190
And the whole illness is supposed to be based 
on this memory.

78
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:47,710
No wonder that all the wild goose chase of 
the psychoanalyst to find out why I am now

79
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:53,230
like this can never come to an end.

80
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:03,470
Can never prove A real opening up of the 
person himself.

81
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,270
Now the same applies to the future.

82
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,670
It seems incredible that we should live 
without goals.

83
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,070
Without worrying about the future.

84
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:28,910
That we could be open and ready for what 
might come.

85
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,750
No, we have to take insurance policies.

86
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:40,550
We have to make sure that we have no future, 
that the status quo should remain,

87
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:43,430
or maybe even be a bit better.

88
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,950
But we mustn't take risks.

89
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:55,430
We mustn't be open that something should 
happen that would be new and exciting.

90
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,350
And contributing to our growth.

91
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:07,910
So much for the now. For the time being.

92
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:17,070
Now the how. Is all we need to understand.

93
00:10:20,750 --> 00:10:24,470
The way we or the world functions.

94
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:29,270
The how gives us perspective orientation.

95
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:38,910
The how shows that the basic one of the basic 
laws,

96
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:44,630
the identity of structure and function is 
valid.

97
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,430
We change the structure.

98
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,590
The function changes. We change the function,

99
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:50,990
the structure changes.

100
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:59,670
The hardest perspective.

101
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,830
The Y gives only an unending inquiry in a 
cause of a cause,

102
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:07,510
of a cause, of a cause, 
of a cause, of a cause.

103
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,830
And as Freud has already observed, 
every event is overdetermined.

104
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:17,350
It has many causes from all kinds of things.

105
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:24,550
Sides come together in order to create the 
specific moment that is the now.

106
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:29,750
Many factors come together to create this 
specific,

107
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:32,750
unique person, which is I.

108
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:43,630
Nobody can at any given moment be different 
from what he is at this moment,

109
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,510
including all the wishes and prayers that he 
should be different.

110
00:11:52,230 --> 00:12:02,070
We are what we are. Now

111
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:10,390
the next objection is how do we bring about 
changes?

112
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:15,670
Apparently there are lots of changes that are 
desirable.

113
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:26,390
To take one instance, 
this unpleasant habit of self-torture.

114
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,670
The answer is changes occur by themselves.

115
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,630
Once the different items are recognized and 
fall into their place.

116
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:48,270
The road to hell is paved with good 
intentions.

117
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:55,070
Any attention to exchange will achieve the 
opposite.

118
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:59,790
You know, all this New Year's resolution.

119
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:03,790
The desperation of being different.

120
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,270
The attempt to control yourself.

121
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:14,390
How this always comes to naught or in extreme 
cases when you really apparently successful

122
00:13:15,510 --> 00:13:18,310
up to the point where the nervous breakdown 
occurs.

123
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:31,030
The final way out. Here again, 
once we

124
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:35,670
recognize the structure of our behavior.

125
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:42,750
Which in the case of self-improvement, 
is the split between a top dog and an

126
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:51,510
underdog. And we understand how by listening,

127
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:56,790
we bring about a reconciliation of the two 
fighting clowns.

128
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:09,510
Or tragic people. Then we realized that we 
cannot deliberately bring

129
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:13,870
about changes in ourselves and in others.

130
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:21,110
The Topdog underdog split works about like 
this.

131
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:31,110
The character differs somewhat, 
but there are certain structures in common.

132
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:36,590
The Topdog usually is righteous, 
knows best.

133
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:46,870
The top dog is a bully and works with you 
should and you should not.

134
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,830
The top dog threatens.

135
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:56,780
If you don't, then there will be catastrophes 
such as you won't be loved,

136
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,660
you won't get to heaven, 
you will die, and so on and so on.

137
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:05,540
All the threads of the top dog, 
the underdog has no power.

138
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,260
The underdog is the Mickey Mouse.

139
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,180
The top dog is the super mouse.

140
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,980
And the underdog works like this.

141
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:24,220
Yeah. Manana I try my best.

142
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,860
Look, I try again and again.

143
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:33,100
I can't help it if I fail I can't help it if 
I forgot your birthday.

144
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,300
I had such good intentions.

145
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:42,300
You see the underdog. The underdog is coming.

146
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:47,420
An underdog strive for control.

147
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:54,260
Like every parent and every child, 
they have each other for control.

148
00:15:56,020 --> 00:16:01,940
Now again, the ways of manipulation of the 
top dog are very simple.

149
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:07,780
Usually, the top dog manipulates with threats 
and demands.

150
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:13,380
The underdog manipulates with being 
defensive,

151
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:20,700
apologetic, wheedling, 
playing the crybaby and such things,

152
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,140
and will come across a lot about if we come 
to talk about the means and ways,

153
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:34,060
how we manipulate each other, 
how we manipulate ourselves in ourselves,

154
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:37,180
and the eternal struggle.

155
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:44,060
It is only one purpose to keep the status quo 
of the neurosis intact.

156
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:54,500
Maybe we have an opportunity here to see that 
one can get through the status quo.

157
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:59,460
If you can't get through the impasse that 
keeps the bad,

158
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:07,380
marriage bad and exhausting instead of 
satisfactory,

159
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:16,460
that keeps the relationship of the therapist 
with the patient in the status quo going on

160
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:26,260
for years and years. Again, 
the condition is

161
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:32,140
and this is the key right now, 
I can only hypnotize you,

162
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:36,260
persuade you, make you believe that I'm 
right.

163
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,500
You don't know. I'm just preaching something.

164
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,780
You won't learn from my words.

165
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,260
Learning is discovery.

166
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,780
There's no other means of effective learning.

167
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:57,620
You can tell a child a thousand times.

168
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,660
The stove is hot. Doesn't help.

169
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,620
The child has to discover it for himself.

170
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,020
And I hope I can assist you in learning, 
in discovering something about yourself.

171
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:20,780
Maybe I can also assist you in learning 
something more about the two worlds than now

172
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:29,700
in the how. I'd like to say a few words about 
the two levels on which we live.

173
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:42,660
The usual idea we encounter is that we see 
the human being as one with a dichotomy

174
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,580
between mind and body.

175
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:55,500
Body and soul, or whatever dichotomy you 
choose if this were true?

176
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:02,900
We always all would be corpses inhabited in 
Habited by a ghost.

177
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:11,620
And this goes on after death can fly away 
into heaven.

178
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,420
And the corpse is being burned.

179
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,700
But in the meantime, it must be alive.

180
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:23,820
It's difficult to assume that such could be 
the split.

181
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:35,660
You see every organism starting as a unit, 
a germ in a plane.

182
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,820
And this unit difference here.

183
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,620
Could you differentiate in opposites?

184
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,700
Right, left, up, down and so on.

185
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:00,540
So we are still left with a question.

186
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,340
What then is this thing we call mind?

187
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,420
The answer was first given by Freud.

188
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:22,820
You see, Freud had devoted his whole life.

189
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:31,580
To prove to himself and to others that sex is 
not bad.

190
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:44,060
And he had to prove that, 
as in his time, the scientific approach was

191
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:53,460
that of causality. That the trouble was 
caused by something in the past like a

192
00:20:53,820 --> 00:21:00,660
billiard cue. Pushing a billiard ball in the 
cue is then the cause of the rolling of the

193
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:06,980
ball in the meantime. Our scientific attitude 
has changed.

194
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:14,180
We don't look to the world anymore in terms 
of cause and effect.

195
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,300
We look upon the world as a continuous, 
ongoing process.

196
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:26,060
We are back to her cry to the pre-Socratic 
Panteri.

197
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,300
Everything is in flux.

198
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,900
We never step into the same river twice.

199
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:40,780
In other words, we have made in science, 
but unfortunately not yet in psychiatry.

200
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:49,220
The transition from one linear causality to 
thinking process from the why to the how.

201
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:05,860
Now for it. When he saw the one thing what he 
called thinking is

202
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,820
probably thinking is rehearsing.

203
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:19,620
You see, if he had accepted the statement of 
his thinking is rehearsing,

204
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,220
he would have realized that our activity is 
turned towards the future.

205
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,500
Because we rehearse for the future.

206
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:44,620
Now. This is not the situation.

207
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:54,340
We live on two levels the public level which 
is our doing.

208
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,420
Observable. Verifiable.

209
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,300
And the private stage.

210
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:11,500
The thinking states that are housing stage in 
which we prepare for future roles.

211
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:19,460
We plan for the roles we want to play.

212
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:30,060
For the means whereby we have to organize in 
order to.

213
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,940
Do what you want to do.

214
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:42,140
Now, it sounds a bit peculiar that this is 
still thinking in the way,

215
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:44,340
making it just a part of role playing.

216
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,340
However, when you look a bit Deep into your 
existence,

217
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,900
our existence, my existence.

218
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,900
You will realize that the pure biological 
being.

219
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,580
The gratification of our instincts.

220
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:14,940
Our sex survival. Breathing plays only a 
minor part in our preoccupation.

221
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:18,540
Especially in a country where we're so 
spoiled,

222
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,940
like in the States where even we don't know 
what it means to be hungry.

223
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:34,700
Where anyone who wants to have sex can have 
sex plentiful.

224
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,620
Anyone who wants to breathe can breathe.

225
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:48,300
The air is tax free. Even the smog in Los 
Angeles is free.

226
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:53,450
For the rest. We play games.

227
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:06,810
We play games to an extent openly into much 
greater extent privately.

228
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,130
Do you think we mostly talk to somebody?

229
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,330
Sometimes we might communicate.

230
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,850
Most times we should. No time.

231
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:24,650
We hypnotize each other.

232
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,810
We hypnotize ourselves that we are right.

233
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:36,210
You play Madison Avenue to convince other 
people or ourselves of our value.

234
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:46,170
And this takes up so much of our energy 
again,

235
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:50,850
that sometimes, if you are unsure about the 
role you're playing,

236
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:56,290
you wouldn't dare to say a word a sentence 
without having it first.

237
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:59,810
Again and again until it fits the occasion.

238
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:10,450
Now, if you're not sure of the role you want 
to play.

239
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:21,170
And you're called away from your pilot stage 
to the public stage like every good actor,

240
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,290
you experience stage fright.

241
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,250
Stage fright is called anxiety.

242
00:26:31,810 --> 00:26:33,850
Anxiety is nothing but stage fright.

243
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,290
Your excitement is only mounting.

244
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:37,650
You want to play a role.

245
00:26:39,850 --> 00:26:41,770
But you don't quite dare.

246
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:45,010
So you go back to restrict your breathing.

247
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:53,530
But the heart pumps out more blood because 
the higher metabolism has to be satisfied.

248
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:57,210
And then once you are on stage.

249
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:04,530
And play the role, the excitement flows into 
your performance.

250
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,250
If not, your performance would be rigid.

251
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:20,650
It's very difficult for us to understand that 
we are always playing.

252
00:27:30,970 --> 00:27:38,650
So no wonder when we try to understand the 
essence of a neurosis that on the first level

253
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:46,130
we find what I call the Sigmund Freud layer, 
the role playing layer.

254
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,650
We Would behave as if.

255
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:54,050
We pretend to be better.

256
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:01,850
Tougher. More polite. And so then you really 
feel.

257
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,890
And you see, when I spoke yesterday about 
manipulation.

258
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:12,330
Whether the child has to play helpless.

259
00:28:14,490 --> 00:28:19,690
Stupid. Polite. Flattering.

260
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:28,770
The child in doing so, 
develops the habit of using this type of

261
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:35,930
manipulation and habit is nothing but a 
performance of the same action that goes

262
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:41,970
easier and easier. It's a grooving of one's 
activity that then becomes a habit,

263
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:44,610
(Transcribed by Sonix.ai - Remove this message by upgrading your Sonix account)
a character, a fixed role.
